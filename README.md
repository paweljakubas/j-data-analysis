# Data analysis using J

These are notes that cover a number of topics that I have
found fundamental to master data analysis using J language. The prerequisite
for fully comprehending the examples below is *Learning J* which is the recommended first
introductory material when learning J. The great example how beautifully and effciently J can be used in a specific domain is
a wonderful *Fractals, Visualization and J*. Besides that a list of high quality book references is specified.
