# Data analysis using J

by Pawel Jakubas, PhD

These are notes that cover a number of topics that I have
found fundamental to master data analysis using J language. The prerequisite
for fully comprehending the examples below is *Learning J* which is the recommended first
introductory material when learning J. The great example how beautifully and effciently J can be used in a specific domain is
a wonderful *Fractals, Visualization and J*. Besides that a list of high quality book references is specified.
The notes are supposed to be hands-on and to illustrate how efficient data analysis can be performed using J.
The topics and techniques presented reflect the author's subjective take on what is crucial to master the many tasks that are
required for powerful data analysis.
